For the previous assignment you were asked to use the design doc mainly for reusability reasoning. This time we expect a much broader approach, including decisions behind the software stack you decided to use (for example did you use SQL and how did you come up with this decision or why did you use something else), decisions behind the specifications/requirements process (did you create some kind of UML in order to have a common base with your team, if yes include it, if not, describe how exactly you ensured everyone was doing what they were expected and show us the tool you used and what you created there), other OOD decisions (for example did you create something specifically in order to make it  scalable? Or reusable? Or something oriented towards some other OOD principle? and if yes, what was this and why). Generally, any decisions that you made through the design and the implementation of the app should be well documented and reasonably explained. There is no right and wrong answer here, as long as you reasonably explain your decisions based on the knowledge you have gained through this semester.
